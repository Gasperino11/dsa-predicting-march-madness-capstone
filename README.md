# Predicting March Madness
This repo contains the work done for my capstone class for master's degree at the University of Missouri. It was done in collaboration with a few other members of my program (listed below under Contributors).

The intent of the project was to build a machine learning model in order to try and predict the outcome of the 2020 NCAA Men's March Madness tournament. With COVID-19 causing the cancelling of the tournament, we pivoted to instead predicting the outcome of the 2019 tournament.

Right now, this repo contains our R Shiny app that goes through the various data exploration and feature extraction we did as well as showing our predicted bracket. The Shiny app is available [here](https://rshiny.dsa.missouri.edu/students/gdgp63/Capstone-Group-12/ShinyApp/) currently, but will likely move to shinyapps.io in the future as I'm sure my ability to host app's on the school's server will go away a few months post-graduation.

The machine learning model code will come at a later date as well.
